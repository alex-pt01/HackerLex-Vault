🛡️ Penetration Testing Notes

This is a **living document** where I collect and organize **penetration 
testing notes** from my personal vault.  
It includes tips, commands, techniques, and references that I add over 
time whenever I have a chance to study or practice.

laws.

The notes are informal and may be rough in some areas, as they're meant 
primarily for personal reference —  
but feel free to explore and learn.
