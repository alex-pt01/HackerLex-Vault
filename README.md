🛡️ Penetration Testing Notes

This is a **living document** where I collect and organize **penetration 
testing notes** from my personal vault.  
It includes tips, commands, techniques, and references that I add over 
time whenever I have a chance to study or practice.

> This content is intended **for educational purposes only**.  
> It must **not** be used to target or compromise any system without 
**proper authorization**.  
> Always follow ethical hacking guidelines and comply with applicable 
laws.

The notes are informal and may be rough in some areas, as they're meant 
primarily for personal reference —  
but feel free to explore and learn.

# Penetration Testing Main Phases

| Phase                                  | Simple Explanation                                                                                 
|
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)** | Collect information about 
the target to understand how it works and where possible entry points are. 
|
| **Scanning and Enumeration**            | Explore the network/system to 
find open ports, active services, and specific details.              |
| **Gaining Access (Exploitation)**       | Use discovered vulnerabilities 
to get into the system or network.                                |
| **Maintaining Access (Post-Exploitation)** | Make sure access stays 
available for future actions, like creating backdoors.                    
|
| **Reporting**                           | Document everything done, 
vulnerabilities found, risks, and how to fix the problems.             |
